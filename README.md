Our project develops an interactive web-based platform to visualize volcanic activity worldwide, leveraging dynamic maps to present data on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), casualties, and economic damages associated with volcanic events. Incorporating advanced features such as a dropdown menu for seamless navigation between different data visualizations and an MP4 video as the background enhances user engagement. This platform serves as an educational and analytical tool, offering insights into the impact of volcanoes over time through an immersive user experience.
